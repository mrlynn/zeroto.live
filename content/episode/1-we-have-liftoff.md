## Introduction 

It's always been a dream of mine to start and run my own business. I've tried and failed on many occassions and this may be yet another one in the long list. But I don't care. Today, I'm launching Zero to Live, a developer media company created solely with the intention of helping developers, founders and dreams in their goal to build amazing things. 

## Why Zero to Live?

The name Zero to Live came from a talk I will deliver at MongoDB .live in June of this year. I came up with the concept around launching a startup on the internet in about 45 minutes. As part of preparing to deliver that talk, I created several assets - this being one of them.

## What will you do?

The concept is simple. I will share what I've learned over the past several years working in the startup, growth marketing world with founders and potential founders. I'll publish a podcast, with accompanying blog articles and sample code, tutorials, etc. 

## Why do anything? Why now?Why ZtoL?

Let's go in order. Why do anything? When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail and right now, my hammer is the knowledge I've gained working with and mentoring technology startup founders, co-founders and developers.
